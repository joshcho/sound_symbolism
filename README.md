# Research Direction
Sound symbolism is already quite a vibrant field. Many linguists already agree on sound symbolism, and in the past ten years [many empirical studies](https://www.nickkolenda.com/brand-names/#naming-step2a) have come out in favor of sound symbolism. [This computational study](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1171.pdf), however, found little correlation between form and meaning. Given this background, here are two ways in which we can take our approach.

1) Limit the scope of our investigation of sound symbolism to a set of words where sound might determine meaning. Thus we are analyzing **whether some identifiable subset of language is more prone to sound symbolism**. The most obvious subset is onomatopoeia, but perhaps more primal / primitive words can be interesting to investigate. Also, we can shift focus from subset of language to comparing different languages, and investigating less abstract languages that place more importance on sound. Western languages are more abstract and tend to have less instances of sound symbolism. This way, we can formulate a hypothesis on how abstract a chosen language is.

2) Test an even more radical hypothesis that **sound determines market value**. Market value can take the form of YouTube subscriber count, stock price, etc. This is much more interesting precisely because the hypothesis is high-risk, high-return. Sound symbolism itself is a reasonable hypothesis, but the notion that phonemes in signifiers can have significant economic impact in the signified is an outlandish, but very interesting hypothesis. Thus we would do well to test the correlation between data sets that have not been well-studied. Given limited time and expertise, we cannot investigate sound symbolism in a significant way compared to the computational study of 100+ languages. But we can investigate whether or not our outlandish hypothesis does turn out to be true.
